# hacker_news_posts

In this project, we'll work with a data set of submissions to a popular site [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) 

The original data set is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts), but it has been reduced from almost 300,000 rows to approximately 20,000 rows by removing all submissions that did not receive any comments, and then randomly sampling the remaining submissions.

In this project we will specifically be interested in posts whose titles begin with either `Ask HN` or `Show HN`. Users submit `Ask HN` posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question. Likewise, users submit `Show HN` posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or just something generally interesting.

We will compare these two types of posts to determine the following:

-  Do `Ask HN` or `Show HN` receive more comments on average?
-  Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?
